<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Philosophy at East China Normal University (ECNU), and currently an exchange student at New York University (NYU), now in my junior year. My academic interests lie in philosophy of mind, AI philosophy, and AI for health. I have also developed a strong foundation in computer science and data analysis, which supports my research.

I have co-authored a paper published in Medicine & Philosophy (CSSCI) on psycho-cardiology clinical practice, and contributed to a submitted paper on AI-assisted remote cardiac rehabilitation to Research (JCR Q1). I am currently working at Pervasive Interaction Lab at Tsinghua University, focusing on a wearable physionet project. 

Outside of academics, I am an avid gamer and cellist. I actively play League of Legends, VALORANT, and Apex Legends, and enjoy narrative-driven and action RPGs on PlayStation, including The Last of Us, The Witcher 3, and Cyberpunk 2077, all of which I got a platinum cup. I am also a fan of Souls-like games<3

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- Investigated cross-model reasoning behavior in large language models through a systematic evaluation of 44 classical syllogistic forms, uncovering consistent structural patterns in deductive inference.
- Identified and analyzed reasoning biases such as valid–invalid asymmetry and middle-term dependence, providing empirical evidence for parallels between machine and human logical reasoning. 

- [Philosophical reflection and educational exploration in the clinical practice of psycho-cardiology. Medicine and Philosophy], Ding, G., **Ge, L.**, Gao, B., **Medicine and Philosophy**
